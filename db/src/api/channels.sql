-- define the view which is just selecting everything from the underlying table
-- although it looks like a user would see all the rows by looking just at this definition,
-- the RLS policy defined on the underlying table attached to the view owner (api_users)
-- will make sure only the appropriate roles will be reviled.
-- notice how for the api we don't expose the owner_id column even though it exists and is used

create or replace view api.channels as
select id, name, (owner_id = request.user_id()) as mine from data.channels;
alter view api.channels owner to api; -- it is important to set the correct owner to the RLS policy kicks in
